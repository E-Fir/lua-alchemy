Port of the Lua programming language for ActionScript using Alchemy.

Alchemy works by translating C/C++ code to ActionScript through a LLVM compiler
which instead of producing machine or bytecode produces ActionScript.
The translated C/C++ code uses a big ActionScript ByteArray as the C/C++ heap and stack.
